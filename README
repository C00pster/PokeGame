This project creates the terrain for an ASCII character based Pokemon game. It uses a queue data structure to generate points and build off of those points in a circle to generate the terrain. The roads and Pokecenter/Pokemarts are placed afterwards

BUGS:
    There is a bug on printing the character 'q' where it exits, yet states invalid command. This is a known issue, but will be resolved
    upon the implementation of the cursors library later in the semester.

    On borders, Pokimarts and Pokicenters sometimes generate off of the path
