This project creates the terrain for an ASCII character based Pokemon game. It uses a queue data structure to generate points and build off of those points in a circle to generate the terrain. The roads and Pokecenter/Pokemarts are placed afterwards.

Running the `make` will create the proper binaries in a bin folder as well as a "run" binary in the main project folder. The game can be started by typing `./run` in the terminal.

BUGS:
    When repeatedly pressing movement keys in quick succession, the game will sometimes freeze. Most of this time
    this is aleviated by waiting, but sometimes the game will then crash (rarely)
